      <h2 className="font-semibold text-lg">What are backlinks?</h2>
      <p className="text-black/70 my-2">
        Backlinks are external or inbound links found on other websites and
        pointing to your website. They are essential for your website as they
        tell Google that you have valuable content, drive some traffic, and
        improve your ranking in search engines. Regarding SEO, backlinks are one
        of the most critical factors affecting your website's ranking in SERPs.
        They indicate that others see your website as a valuable information
        resource. However, it is not just about linking websites to each other.
        You should pay attention to the quantity, quality, and relevance of your
        website's backlinks because these factors help your website rank in
        SERPs. Therefore, it is essential to keep your eyes open and track your
        website's backlinks to identify any potential issues harming your
        website. For example, some bad backlinks may lower your ranking in
        search results.
